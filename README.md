Hi, I'm Soham 👋  
Computer Science & Engineering student interested in automation, infrastructure, and distributed systems. I've worked as a SWE Intern twice at HPE/Juniper Networks.

### Selected Projects:

- Deterministic agent orchestration using a LangGraph state machine, retrieval-augmented context from a vectorized codebase, and webhook-driven integration with GitHub, designed for reliability, auditability, and human-in-the-loop control.
